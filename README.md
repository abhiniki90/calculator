# Building the calculator

## Overview

The calculator consist of two parts: the display and the keys. Furthermore, there is a Logs section that will display all the history computed by the user.

Here a Calculator is going to be formed with HTML code.

### Calculator Title: This is the title at the top of my application.
### Output Screen: This will be the output screen, where all text will be shown as the input that the user will type and the answer calculated from the user input. So, we can again break down this into two smaller pieces as shown below:
#### Question Output: This will be the input given by the user.
#### Answer Output: This will be the result calculated from user input.

In this project, I have learned the following:

1. Setting Up a HTML Project
2. Working with CSS to manupulate the context is shown to user
3. Lesarning the JavaScript and its control flow
4. Error handling using console.log()
5. DOM manipulation
6. Functional approach


CHALLENGES

The only challenge I faced while doing this project is to get the details in the input and compute those upon "=" click. To overcome the issue, I used an API using DOM to get the result from html page. Also, I used the eval() to compute the arithmetic logic.

FUN PART

Apart from the challenge which was one of the fun parts, I believe working with JavaScript was fun as well. To display the dynamic details, JS is very useful.Furthermore, I think I would need to work more on this to get familiar with JavaScript language and its tools.
